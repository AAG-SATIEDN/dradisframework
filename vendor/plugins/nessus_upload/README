NessusUpload
================

The Nessus upload plugin will enable user to upload Nessus output files in the
nessus client format (.nessus) to create a structure of nodes/notes that contain
the same information about the hosts/ports/services as the original file.

Details about the NessusClient file format can be found here:
www.nessus.org/documentation/dot_nessus_file_format.pdf

Other formats (nbe, nsr) are not supported at the moment.

To create a .nessus file just click on File -> Save As in your nessus gui (version 4.x)

The config file allows you to control parts of the behaviour of the plugin. I will add
a detailed description in a later release...
