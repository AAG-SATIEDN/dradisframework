VulndbImport
============

This plugin can be used to connect the dradis framework to a remote vulnerability
database. The idea is to have a database with commonly used notes that you can
import to your current project.

The plugin uses JSON to grab the data from the remote server. See the
configuration parameters in ./conf/vulndb_import.yml. 

The current version is tailored to connect to a rails application that makes use
of the ext_scaffold plugin:

http://rug-b.rubyforge.org/svn/ext_scaffold

Example
=======

A sample request as will be made by this plugin could be:

http://localhost/vulnerabilities?format=ext_json&fields=["id","vulnerability[title]","vulnerability[body]"]&query=cookie

The query above will look for the string "cookie" in the "id", "title" and 
"body" fields of the vulnerability database. The expected return format is given 
by ext_scaffold. An example could be:

{
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {"vulnerability": 
      {
        "created_at": "2008-12-11T13:24:48Z", 
        "title": "Insecure Cookie Configuration", 
        "body": "[...]", 
        "updated_at": "2008-12-11T13:24:48Z", 
        "id": 9
      }
    }, 
    {"vulnerability": 
      {
        "created_at": "2008-12-11T13:27:42Z", 
        "title": "Session Token in URL", 
        "body": "[...]", 
        "updated_at": "2009-03-18T10:59:21Z", 
        "id": 12
      }
    }
  ], 
  "results": 2
}

Only the "title" and "body" fields are used by the framework.
