WordExport
==========

This plugin will extract information from the dradis repository and generate a
WordXML report with it. The report is based on a customizable template 
(template.xml).

In the current version, the different fields associated with a note are all 
stored in the note's "text" field and accessible through the .fields() instance
method. 

Example
=======
Internally the note's text has to follow this format: 

#[<field #1 name>]# 
<field contents #1>

#[<field #2 name>]
<field contents #2>
...

For example:
 
#[Title]#
Insecure Cookie Configuration

#[Description]
Several flags that add an extra layer of security to HTTP cookies were 
found not to be in use by the application.[...] 
 

The plugin will split the note text in fields and values, and then will 
locate the corresponding placeholders in the XML template. These 
placeholders are located using XPath. For instance if the field name is
"Title" we will try to locate a tag with id="vulntitle", if it is 
"Description" we will try to locate a tag with id="vulndescription", etc.

Once the placeholder is found, the field value is splited in lines and a 
new Word XML paragraph is attached to the placeholder for each line. For 
example:

  <wx:sub-section id="vulndescription">
    <w:p>
      <w:pPr><w:pStyle w:val="Heading2"/></w:pPr>
      <w:r><w:t>Description</w:t></w:r>
    </w:p>
         # <-- the contents of the Description field will be placed here
  </wx:sub-section>

A template can have multiple sections, this is useful to have information about
your notes in more than one location. Think "summary table" and "issue details".

This is done by tagging the template with dummy XML:


<dradisplaceholder id="section">
  <!-- the summary table section -->
</dradisplaceholder>

<dradisplaceholder id="section">
  <!-- the issue details section -->
</dradisplaceholder>

For each "section" in the document, the plugin will cycle through all the notes
and will try to fill all the placeholders. For instance, the summary section 
may use only the Title and Impact fields while the details section uses all of
the fields in a note.

See template.xml for a sample WordXML template document and instructions.xml for
additional instructions on the use of the plugin.
