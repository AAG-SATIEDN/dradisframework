Description:
    Stubs out a new dradis export plugin. Pass the plugin name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as an argument. The plugin name will be extended with '_export'
    if this is not part of the plugin name argument.

    This creates a plugin in vendor/plugins including an init.rb and README
    as well as standard lib, task, and test directories.

Note:
    The basic structure is exactly the same as a standard Rails plugin. With a the
    unneeded files and code removed and a bit of customisation to fit the dradis
    export pugin requirements.

Example:
    `./script/generate plugin BrowserFilters`

    creates a standard browser_filters plugin:
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/README
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/init.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/install.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/lib/browser_filters.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/test/browser_filters_test.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/tasks/browser_filters_tasks.rake
