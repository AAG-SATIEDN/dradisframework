dradis export plugin
--------------------

A framework for a dradis export plugin has been created for you in the
vendor/plugins/<plugin name>_export folder. Inspect the list above for a full
list of the files and directories that was created.

In 99% of cases you will only be concerned with the
vendor/plugins/<plugin name>_export/<plugin name>_export.rb and
vendor/plugins/<plugin name>_export/<plugin name>_export/actions.rb files.
The content of these files will give you some guidance on how to go ahead.

For a tutorial on how to get you started have a look at:
