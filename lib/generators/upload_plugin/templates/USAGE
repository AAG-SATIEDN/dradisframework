dradis upload plugin
--------------------

A framework for a dradis upload plugin has been created for you in the
vendor/plugins/<plugin name>_upload folder. Inspect the list above for a full
list of the files and directories that were created.

In 99% of cases you will only be concerned with the
vendor/plugins/<plugin name>_upload/lib/<plugin name>_upload.rb and
vendor/plugins/<plugin name>_upload/lib/<plugin name>_upload/filters.rb files.
The content of these files will give you some guidance on how to go ahead.

Another source of information is the dradis forum that has a dedicated topic
for import and export plugins:
